# MTC-Robotics-Portfolio
This repository serves as a centralized collection of my coursework, projects, assignments, notes, and resources from all ITAI courses in the Associates in Artificial Intelligence program. It includes code implementations, reports, datasets, and learning materials organized by course/module for easy reference and portfolio building.
