AI in Machine Learning
Course Overview
This repository contains my coursework and projects from AI in Machine Learning, part of the Associates in Artificial Intelligence program. The course covered foundational machine learning techniques, with a focus on regression models for predictive tasks. Key topics included data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection (e.g., linear regression, tree-based models, ensembles), evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, R²), and addressing real-world challenges like skewed data, outliers, and market applications such as pricing prediction.
Skills and Technologies

Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn for modeling (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN), XGBoost for gradient boosting, and ensemble methods (Voting Regressor, Bayesian weighted average).
Data Handling: Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations (heatmaps, violin plots, pairplots).
Preprocessing: Outlier detection/removal, feature engineering (e.g., deriving Car Age), label/one-hot encoding for categorical data, StandardScaler for normalization.
Concepts: Regression for price prediction, correlation analysis, handling imbalanced/skewed distributions, model tuning for accuracy and generalization, and business applications (e.g., fair car pricing amid market distrust and tariffs).
Environment: Jupyter Notebook for development and experimentation.

Featured Projects

Creation of a Multi-Regression Model: Developed a Bayesian Ensemble model to predict car sale prices using features like age, mileage, brand, and condition. Achieved near-perfect R² (0.9999) on a dataset of ~10,000 cars, outperforming baselines. README.md
