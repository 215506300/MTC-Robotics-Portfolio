Robot Operating System
Course Overview
This repository contains my coursework and projects from Robot Operating System, part of the Associates in Artificial Intelligence program. The course focused on robotics hardware integration, remote system management, AI-driven interactivity, and real-time processing using Raspberry Pi. Key topics included SSH-based remote access, speech processing (STT/TTS), API integration with ChatGPT for natural language responses, and mapping AI outputs to physical robot actions like gestures.
Skills and Technologies

Robotics Frameworks: PiCar-X library for motor/servo control, integration with ROS-like environments on Raspberry Pi OS (kernel 6.12.47).
AI and NLP: OpenAI API for ChatGPT to generate context-aware responses with JSON-structured actions.
Speech Processing: SpeechRecognition for STT, pyttsx3 for TTS, handling audio inputs and verbal outputs.
Hardware/Software Integration: Raspberry Pi 5 setup with preassembled kits, SD card management for configurations, camera handling with OpenCV.
Tools and Concepts: Virtual environments (venv), SSH with X forwarding for remote development, error handling (e.g., timeouts, audio errors), latency optimization, and gesture mapping (nod, shake head, wave).
Environment: Linux on Raspberry Pi 5, Python 3.12+ for scripting.

Featured Projects

PiCar-X with Raspberry Pi5 and Chat GPT Integration: Built an interactive robot using a preassembled PiCar-X kit, integrating ChatGPT for voice commands and gestures. Overcame hardware failure by swapping SD cards; achieved engaging conversations with actions like nodding. README.md
